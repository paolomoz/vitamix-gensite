      "mainContent": "Every chain store operator knows that beverages need to be consistent from store to store. The customer experience depends on it. But now an additional concern about consistency is also getting a lot of attention: Is the beverage consistently blended throughout? Many beverages have become harder to blend in recent years, raising concerns about this type of consistency. Some hard-to-blend recipes have been around for years, such as smoothie bowls and hard ice cream blends, but others are more recent: Extra-thick smoothies with hard ice cream component and protein powders, Healthy, low-sugar smoothies with powdered additives, Recipes that reduce liquid contents or are based on mixes and concentrates. Some commercial blenders may have difficulty with recipes like these. They may become slow or bogged down. The result may be something short of a truly consistent blend with the same ideal texture throughout.",

      "mainContent": "Beverage products from Nestlé Professional™ Vitality, including coffees, specialty drinks and mixers, and patented dispensing systems, can be found on nearly every cruise ship in the world. With cruise line customers' incredibly high volumes, service time expectations, and training costs, Vitality needed a blending machine that would operate easily with the push of a button and stand up to years of demanding use. Vitality Cruise Ship Services and Customer Relations Manager Pam Elliott says the best thing about the Vitamix Portion Blending System is its sturdiness and reliability under extremely heavy use. 'A regular restaurant might make 10, 20, or even 100 frozen drinks in a day, but on a cruise ship, they'll make 2,000 to 3,000 just in an afternoon. And not just cocktails, but smoothies, too,' said Elliott. 'We needed a machine that could withstand that kind of volume while consistently producing high-quality beverages. We've tested other machines, but the Vitamix Portion Blending System is the only one that's been able to meet our high standards.' Elliott says reliability is especially important to cruise lines as a ship will often be in port for only a day or two at a time, leaving little time for maintenance and repairs. 'The less time we have to spend servicing a machine, the more time that machine can be making drinks—and profits—for us and our cruise line customers,' Elliott said.",

Not finding a suitable machine on the market, executives turned to Vitamix for its reputation of innovative, long-lasting household blenders. Engineers quickly got to work designing what would become their first commercial product: the Vitamix Mix'n Machine. Combining the premium, easy-to-clean components that Vitamix is known for with simple, intuitive controls, the Mix'n Machine took the guesswork out of frozen treats, so the same product could be created across countless operators, services, and locations. The company now has a Vitamix machine in over 30,000 worldwide locations, and attributes an estimated $460 million of annual profit to frozen desserts. While other kitchen equipment has had to be replaced multiple times over the years, many of the original Vitamix machines are still in operation. More recently, the chain has utilized Vitamix technology to expand its frozen beverage menu with smoothies and frozen coffees. The Mix'n Machine and the Mix'n Machine® Advance® are used in thousands of fast food chain locations around the world. If the world's leading chains can depend on Vitamix for quality and consistency, what could a frozen treat program do for your business?",

Part 2 reviews beverage trends as a background for creating unique smoothie recipes. You don't have to be a multi-store smoothie chain to find success selling smoothies. But you do have to do your homework. National smoothie chains already offer a wide variety of made-to-order smoothies that run the gamut from classic flavor combinations to veggie-based varieties and decadent treats. What is your business able to offer that they don't already? The answer lies in your unique M.O. or brand. Your business is successful because you already offer something that your customers cannot get somewhere else. The trick is to define that thing. Then, tailor your smoothie offering to align with it. Your advertising or PR agency can help you define your brand, but here are a few notes to get you started. A brand or M.O. can be defined as the sum of all experiences that your audiences have with your business and its products and services. It can be expressed in a sentence or two. It doesn't have to be complicated, but it should meet three basic criteria, which is sometimes called TRU: True: Is it objectively true? Is it believable? Can we prove it? Relevant: Is it important to your audiences? Does it motivate them to act in some way? Unique: Does it differentiate you from the competition? Is it memorable and attention-getting?",

To put it another way, plan on $100,000 of revenue for every $5,000 of year-end profit. That's a difficult line to walk and anything you can do to address waste reduction in the kitchen will help keep you in business. Controlling Waste During Production: Your food-cost calculations were based on getting a set yield from every ingredient you buy. Unless you track waste continuously, you won't know how accurate these numbers are. Haste leads to sloppy peeling and cutting, and this can drive up your cost on produce, meats and everything else you prepare in-house. Assign each cook a prep bucket for trim and wastage. Review it regularly to make sure they're meeting your standards. Poor portion-size management can also be an issue. Use a scale to check your cooks' portioning of costly meats and fish. Use standardized serving utensils that also act as portioning tools for your side dishes.",

The Slow Food movement, however, has surpassed the fad phase and laid down roots in the culinary world. In 1986, Carlo Petrini conceived the Slow Food Movement in defiance of a proposed McDonald's at the base of the Spanish Steps in Rome. Three years later, the movement formally established itself with the signing of the Slow Food Manifesto in Paris. Though modest in its beginnings, Slow Food now has national associations in over 160 countries. In 2013, the United Nations Environment Programme bestowed Petrini with its highest honor, the Champions of the Earth award, for his work in the movement. The Slow Food movement is much more than a farm-to-table approach to cuisine. The movement bases itself on three fundamental tenets: whole foods in the food service industry and at home, clean production methods that preserve the environment and fair pricing for both consumers and producers.",

There are three main levels of Certified Green Restaurants®: 2-, 3-, and 4-stars. Restaurants are awarded a certain number of points across seven categories, according to predetermined standards. The categories are: Water Efficiency, Waste Reduction & Recycling, Sustainable Durable Goods & Building Materials, Sustainable Food, Energy, Reusables & Environmentally Preferable Disposables, and Chemical & Pollution Reduction. To receive certification, a restaurant must: Accumulate a total of 100 GreenPoints™, Meet Minimum Green Points™ in each category (10 points in each), Have a full-scale recycling program, Be free of polystyrene foam (styrofoam), Yearly Education, Continual Change: By the end of Year 3, restaurant must have 135 GreenPoints™, By the end of Year 6, restaurant must have 175 GreenPoints™.",

For restaurants, this can provide a unique opportunity to offer special holiday desserts or pastries—both for guests who are dining in, and taking out. Some restaurants even expand their catering offerings to provide full trays of desserts for events. So as you prepare for the holidays, here are a few ways to get creative with your holiday dessert menu. Make the Most of Seasonal Flavors The holidays are full of flavors that evoke happy memories of the holidays—from pumpkin, cinnamon, and pecan around Halloween and Thanksgiving, to egg nog, nutmeg, and peppermint around Christmas time. These are flavors that are generally easy to work into pastries and are always crowd-pleasers. Pie Junkie in Oklahoma City has the right idea when it comes to putting a creative twist on some of their seasonal desserts. They do a pumpkin pie with a maple bourbon whipped cream and an orange bourbon pecan pie. For the holidays, they usually sell out of their offerings within a 48-hour time period. GT Fish & Oyster in Chicago has an even more unique dine-in dessert for the fall holidays: the deep-fried pumpkin. It's stuffed with sweet potato and cinnamon ice cream, apple sorbet, and gingerbread cake, and topped with meringue.",

This natural drive and curiosity spurred his desire to explore art, more specifically, sculpting. Through this medium, he learned the creative process and how to manipulate a raw ingredient into something he could truly identify with. As Aquilino grew up, he applied his creative talents to the kitchen, shifting his medium of choice to food, instead of clay. While it may be a disconnect to some, to Aquilino, the parallel between art and food is clear. \"Whether it's clay, paint or food, the creative goal is usually the same — to make something beautiful that affects someone's mood, to really intersect with people in a more powerful and emotional way,\" he says. Now, as the corporate executive chef of Envision Group, a division of Compass Group, the world's largest foodservice corporation, Aquilino has the ability to do just that.",

Smoothies are hard to beat for stopping power in the aisle because of their bright colors that telegraph health, well-being, and great taste. And, they can be consumed at any time of the day, with any meal – including breakfast – or between meals as a healthy snack or treat. Smoothies are also a treat for your bottom line, if you choose your ingredients carefully. For example, frozen fruit costs less than fresh fruit, keeps longer, and delivers stronger flavor without any compromise in terms of vitamins or other nutrients. If you're preparing smoothies to set out on ice or in a refrigerated cabinet, there are a few things to keep in mind. If you use frozen fruit, you may not need ice as an ingredient. If possible, try to avoid ice or water because when the beverage sits, the water will separate out. Fresh spinach and leafy greens contain lots of water, so it is best to avoid these as well.",
