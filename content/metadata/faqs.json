      "question": "Is it normal for my Vitamix to be loud?",
      "answer": "Vitamix blenders operate at 88-92 decibels at maximum speed, similar to a garbage disposal. This is normal due to the powerful motor. For quieter operation, use lower speeds when possible, or consider the Quiet One model designed for noise-sensitive environments.",

      "question": "Why does my Vitamix smell like burning?",
      "answer": "A slight burning smell during heavy blending (like nut butters) can be normal as the motor works hard. However, if the smell persists or smoke appears, stop immediately and unplug. This may indicate the thermal protection has activated. Let it cool for 45 minutes before trying again. Contact support if the issue continues.",
