If the blender will not start  immediately check to make sure you have plugged the unit in and the On/Off switch is On. If the  motor has overheated, allow the motor to cool for 20-45 minutes. Tips to prevent ‘overloading’ your blender:  Process only Vitamix recipes when learning to use the blender. Do not process recipes at lower  speeds than recommended. Do not process recipes at higher speeds than recommended. Do not process recipes for longer than recommended. Use your tamper to process thicker  mixtures and keep ingredients moving around and through the blades. Tamper   - Lids and tampers are not interchangeable between different container styles, types  and sizes. Use the tamper that was supplied with your blender. The container should not be more than two-thirds full when the tamper is used during blending. To avoid overheating, DO NOT use the tamper for more than 30 consecutive seconds. 6  Container, Lid, Lid Plug and Tamper  Accessories  Accessories are available for creative recipe development.

WARNING  To Avoid Injury. NEVER TOUCH MOVING PARTS. Keep hands and utensils out of containers and cups during blender operation. DO NOT   insert  fingers or utensils around the blades while the blades are spinning. The blades will continue to spin until they come to a complete stop at the end of the blend cycle. Allow the blades to come to a complete stop before handling the blade base and cups. Put a clean and dry seal onto and then firmly tighten the blade base onto the cup or bowl  BEFORE blending. Do not fill the cup beyond the maximum capacity line or the bowl beyond the 8oz fill line. If the cup becomes un-threaded from the blade base during operation, turn the machine OFF and  wait until the motor and blades come to a complete stop before attempting to remove the cup  and blade base from the motor base. WARNING  DO NOT use your 20 oz. (0.6 L) cup or 8 oz. (225 ml) bowl to heat ingredients or to blend hot liquids.

Conseils pour prévenir la « surcharge » de votre mélangeur :  Pour apprendre à utiliser le mélangeur, ne préparez que des recettes Vitamix. Ne réduisez pas les  vitesses de préparation recommandées pour les recettes. Ne dépassez pas les vitesses de préparation  recommandées pour les recettes. Ne dépassez pas les temps de mélange recommandés pour les  recettes. Utilisez votre pilon pour préparer des mélanges plus épais et garder les ingrédients en  mouvement autour des couteaux et entre ceux-ci. Pilon   - Les couvercles et les pilons ne sont pas interchangeables entre les récipients de différents styles,  types et formats. Utilisez le pilon qui a été fourni avec votre mélangeur. Le récipient ne doit pas être rempli plus qu'aux deux tiers lorsque le pilon est utilisé pendant le mélange. Pour éviter de faire surchauffer l'appareil pendant le mélange, N'utilisez PAS le pilon pendant plus de  30 secondes consécutives. 18  Récipient, couvercle, bouchon du couvercle et pilon  •   Utilisez toujours le couvercle et le bouchon du couvercle pendant le mélange. •   Ne faites jamais fonctionner le mélangeur sans vous assurer que le couvercle est  bien verrouillé en place. •   Le bouchon du couvercle comporte un marquage qui permet de l'utiliser comme  tasse à mesurer. •   Insérez   le   bouchon   du   couvercle   dans   l'orifice   pour   bouchon   du   couvercle. Fixez le bouchon en place en le tournant dans le sens horaire. Pour l'enlever,  tournez-le dans le sens antihoraire et soulevez-le.",

CE QUI N'EST PAS COUVERT. Cette garantie ne s'applique pas aux mélangeurs utilisés pour des applications commerciales ou autres que domestiques. Cette garantie ne couvre pas les changements  superficiels qui n'affectent pas la performance de l'appareil comme la décoloration, les effets de l'utilisation d'abrasifs ou de nettoyants ou les accumulations d'aliments. Cette  garantie n'est valable que si le mélangeur est utilisé et entretenu conformément aux instructions, aux avertissements et aux consignes de sécurité contenus dans le manuel  d'utilisation.

Des traces de sable, des herbes abrasives ou comportant de gros grains peuvent également causer une usure prématurée  des couteaux. Des herbes peuvent également contenir des huiles volatiles, ce qui entraîne une rétention des huiles par le récipient/la tasse et ainsi une décoloration  permanente de ces objets.

BLENDING  6   149301  WARNING  To Avoid Injury. NEVER TOUCH MOVING PARTS. Keep hands and utensils out of the container during appliance operation. NEVER insert fingers or utensils around the blades while the blades are spinning. NEVER fill the container above the “MAXIMUM CAPACITY” line to avoid risk of injury caused by damage to the lid and container. To avoid possible burns, NEVER start on speeds above Variable Speed 1 when processing hot liquids in a large container. Escaping steam, splashes, or contents may burn. ALWAYS operate with the lid and lid plug in place and start on Variable Speed 1, then slowly increase to 10. Parts will become hot with extended use. NEVER touch the motor base drive socket or the drive spline in the blade base. TIPS TO PREVENT OVERHEATING  •   Process only Vitamix recipes when learning to use the appliance. •   NEVER process recipes at lower or higher speeds than recommended. Speed is indicated both numerically and visually by the completion of the circular indicator around the number as illustrated below. USER NOTIFICATIONS  •   Overheating Notification   - NEVER process recipes for longer than recommended. Over-processed blends can result in the incorrect recipe texture and overheat the appliance. The temperature indicators help identify overheating conditions. •   Use Tamper Notification   - Use the tamper to process thicker mixtures and keep ingredients moving around and through the blades. The tamper indicators, available on the Ascent X4 and X5 models, help during recipe programs to determine the best times to use the tamper.",

NE TOUCHEZ JAMAIS LES PIÈCES EN MOUVEMENT. Gardez les mains et les ustensiles hors du récipient pendant le fonctionnement de l'appareil. N' insérez jamais vos doigts ou des ustensiles autour des lames lorsque celles-ci tournent. NE remplissez JAMAIS le récipient au-dessus de la ligne « CAPACITÉ MAXIMALE » marquée pour éviter tout risque de blessure causée par des dommages au couvercle et au récipient. Pour éviter d'éventuelles brûlures, NE COMMENCEZ JAMAIS à des vitesses supérieures à la vitesse variable 1 lors du traitement de liquides chauds dans un grand récipient. La vapeur qui s'échappe, les éclaboussures ou le contenu peuvent brûler. UTILISEZ TOUJOURS avec le couvercle et le bouchon en place et commencez à vitesse variable 1, puis augmentez lentement jusqu'à 10. Les pièces deviennent chaudes en cas d'utilisation prolongée. NE touchez JAMAIS la douille d'entraînement de la base du moteur ou la cannelure d'entraînement de la base de la lame. CONSEILS POUR ÉVITER LA SURCHAUFFE  •   Préparez uniquement des recettes Vitamix lorsque vous apprenez à vous servir de votre appareil. •   Ne préparez JAMAIS les recettes à une vitesse inférieure ou supérieure à celle recommandée.

NUNCA inserte los dedos o utensilios alrededor de las aspas mientras las aspas están girando. NUNCA llene la jarra por encima de la línea de “CAPACIDAD MÁXIMA” para evitar el riesgo de lesiones causadas por daños en la tapa y la jarra. Para evitar posibles quemaduras, NUNCA comience a velocidades superiores a la velocidad variable 1 cuando procese líquidos calientes en un jarra grande. El vapor que se escapa, las salpicaduras o el contenido pueden quemar. OpereSIEMPRE con la tapa y la tapita dosificadora en su lugar y comience en Velocidad variable 1, luego aumente lentamente a 10. Las piezas se calentarán con el uso prolongado. NUNCA toque el acople en la base del motor ni el eje estriado motriz en la base de las aspas. CONSEJOS PARA EVITAR EL SOBRECALENTAMIENTO  •   Procese únicamente recetas Vitamix cuando esté aprendiendo a usar el aparato. •   NUNCA procese recetas a velocidades menores o mayores que las recomendadas. La velocidad se indica tanto numérica como visualmente al completarse el indicador circular alrededor del número, como se ilustra a continuación. NOTIFICACIONES DE USUARIO  •   Notificación de sobrecalentamiento:   NUNCA procese recetas por más tiempo del recomendado. Las mezclas procesadas en exceso pueden dar como resultado una textura incorrecta de la receta y sobrecalentar el aparato. Los indicadores de temperatura ayudan a identificar las condiciones de sobrecalentamiento. •   Utilice el aviso de la barra presionadora:   utilice la barra presionadora para procesar mezclas más espesas y mantener los ingredientes en movimiento alrededor y a través de las aspas. Los indicadores de barra presionadora, disponibles en los modelos Ascent X4 y X5, ayudan durante los programas de recetas a determinar los mejores momentos para utilizar la barra presionadora.",

Only use the tamper with the lid securely locked in place and the lid plug removed. If a tamper came with your appliance at purchase, it is the correct tamper to use. If a tamper did not come with your appliance or you want to determine if a tamper you already have can be used with your new container, use these steps and illustrations to determine what tamper to use: 1. Place the lid on an empty container. 2. Remove the lid plug and insert the tamper through the lid plug opening. The tamper should fit easily into the opening. It should NOT come into contact with the blades no matter where you move the tamper inside the container. 3.

A non-step tamper MUST NOT be used with any Vitamix container. HOW TO USE THE TAMPER:  IMPORTANT! The splash disk (near the top of the tamper) and lid prevent the tamper from hitting the blades when the lid is secured properly in the locked position. •   The container should not be more than two-thirds full when the tamper is used during blending. •   To avoid overheating during blending, DO NOT use the tamper for more than 30 consecutive seconds. •   If the food does not circulate, there may be a trapped air bubble. Carefully remove the lid plug, while making sure the lid stays firmly in place. Release the air bubble by inserting the tamper through the lid plug opening. •   Holding the tamper straight down may not help the ingredients circulate. If necessary, point the tamper towards the sides or corners of the container. DO NOT try to force the tamper deeper into the container.

Keep hands and utensils out of the container during appliance operation. NEVER insert fingers or utensils around the blades while the blades are spinning. The blades will continue to spin until they come to a complete stop at the end of the blend cycle. NEVER fill the container above the marked “MAXIMUM CAPACITY” line to avoid risk of injury caused by damage to the lid and container. NEVER attempt to place a container on an operating motor base or operate a motor base without a container properly in place. To avoid possible burns, NEVER start on speeds above Variable Speed 1 when processing hot liquids in a large container. Escaping steam, splashes, or contents may burn.",

Failure to register your product purchase will not diminish your warranty rights. However, registering your purchase will allow Vitamix to better serve you with any of your customer service needs.  2. Who Can Seek Warranty Coverage.  This Warranty is extended by Vitamix to the owner of this Blender for personal household use only. This Warranty does not apply to products used for commercial, rental or re-sale purposes. Should ownership of the blender change during the 7-year period, please update the Blender’s owner information at www.vitamix.com.  3. What is Covered.  Vitamix warrants to the owner that if this Blender (a “Blender” consists of a motor base, any container(s), lids and tamper(s) pur- chased together) fails within 7 years from the earlier of the date of purchase or date of delivery as permitted by law due to a defect in material or workmanship or as a result of normal wear and tear from ordinary household use, Vitamix will, within 30 days of receipt of the returned blender, repair the failed Blender or component part of the Blender free of charge. If, in Vitamix’s sole discretion, the failed Blender or component part of the Blender cannot be repaired, Vitamix will elect to either (A) replace the Blender free of charge or (B) refund the full purchase price to the owner, unless Vitamix receives prior written notice of the owner’s preference.  4. What is Not Covered.  This Warranty does not apply to Blenders used commercially or in non-household applications. This Warranty does not cover cosmetic changes that do not affect performance, such as discoloration or the effects of the use of abrasives or cleaners or food build up. This Warranty is only valid if the Blender is used and maintained in accordance with the instructions, warnings and safeguards contained in the owner’s manual.  Containers: Grinding certain herbs and spices in the container/cup will result in cosmetic marring of the container/cup and may cause the blades to wear prematurely. Traces of sand, coarse gritty and abrasive herbs will also cause the blades to wear prematurely. Herbs may contain volatile oils, cause the container/cup to retain the oils and cause permanent discoloration. Your container/cup and blades are not covered under the Vitamix warranty under these circumstances.  Vitamix will not be responsible for the cost of any unauthorized warranty repairs.  REPAIR, REPLACEMENT OR REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ARE THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES OF PURCHASER AND THE SOLE LIABILITY OF VITAMIX UNDER THIS WARRANTY.

Some states do not allow limits on warranties. In such states, the above limitations may not apply to you. Outside the U.S.A. and Canada, other warranties may apply. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.  5. What Voids this Warranty.  Abuse, misuse, negligent use, alteration of the Blender, exposure to abnormal or extreme conditions, or failure to follow the operating instructions in this manual will void this Warranty. The Warranty is also void if repairs to the Blender or any component part of the Blender are performed by someone other than either Vitamix or an authorized Vitamix Service Provider or if any component part of a Blender subject to this Warranty is used in combination with a motor base or container that is not expressly authorized by Vitamix.  6.

Placez le couvercle sur un récipient vide. 2. Retirez le bouchon du couvercle et insérer le pilon par l'ouverture du bouchon du couvercle. Le pilon doit s'insérer facilement dans l'ouverture. Il ne doit PAS entrer en contact avec les lames, peu importe où vous déplacez le pilon à l'intérieur. 3.

Failure to register your product purchase will not diminish your warranty rights. However, registering your purchase will allow Vitamix to better serve you with any of your customer service needs.  2. Who Can Seek Warranty Coverage.  This Warranty is extended by Vitamix to the owner of this Blender for personal household use only. This Warranty does not apply to products used for commercial, rental or re-sale purposes. Should ownership of the blender change during the 7-year period, please update the Blender’s owner information at www.vitamix.com.  3. What is Covered.  Vitamix warrants to the owner that if this Blender (a “Blender” consists of a motor base, any container(s), lids and tamper(s) pur- chased together) fails within 7 years from the earlier of the date of purchase or date of delivery as permitted by law due to a defect in material or workmanship or as a result of normal wear and tear from ordinary household use, Vitamix will, within 30 days of receipt of the returned blender, repair the failed Blender or component part of the Blender free of charge. If, in Vitamix’s sole discretion, the failed Blender or component part of the Blender cannot be repaired, Vitamix will elect to either (A) replace the Blender free of charge or (B) refund the full purchase price to the owner, unless Vitamix receives prior written notice of the owner’s preference.  4. What is Not Covered.  This Warranty does not apply to Blenders used commercially or in non-household applications. This Warranty does not cover cosmetic changes that do not affect performance, such as discoloration or the effects of the use of abrasives or cleaners or food build up. This Warranty is only valid if the Blender is used and maintained in accordance with the instructions, warnings and safeguards contained in the owner’s manual.

Herbs may contain volatile oils, cause the container/cup to retain the oils and cause permanent discoloration. Your container/cup and blades are not covered under the Vitamix warranty under these circumstances.  Vitamix will not be responsible for the cost of any unauthorized warranty repairs.

Failure to register your product purchase will not diminish your warranty rights. However, registering your purchase will allow Vitamix to better serve you with any of your customer service needs.  2. Who Can Seek Warranty Coverage.  This Warranty is extended by Vitamix to the owner of this Blender for personal household use only. This Warranty does not apply to products used for commercial, rental or re-sale purposes. Should ownership of the blender change during the 7-year period, please update the Blender’s owner information at www.vitamix.com.  3. What is Covered.  Vitamix warrants to the owner that if this Blender (a “Blender” consists of a motor base, any container(s), lids and tamper(s) pur- chased together) fails within 7 years from the earlier of the date of purchase or date of delivery as permitted by law due to a defect in material or workmanship or as a result of normal wear and tear from ordinary household use, Vitamix will, within 30 days of receipt of the returned blender, repair the failed Blender or component part of the Blender free of charge. If, in Vitamix’s sole discretion, the failed Blender or component part of the Blender cannot be repaired, Vitamix will elect to either (A) replace the Blender free of charge or (B) refund the full purchase price to the owner, unless Vitamix receives prior written notice of the owner’s preference.  4. What is Not Covered.  This Warranty does not apply to Blenders used commercially or in non-household applications. This Warranty does not cover cosmetic changes that do not affect performance, such as discoloration or the effects of the use of abrasives or cleaners or food build up. This Warranty is only valid if the Blender is used and maintained in accordance with the instructions, warnings and safeguards contained in the owner’s manual.  Containers: Grinding certain herbs and spices in the container/cup will result in cosmetic marring of the container/cup and may cause the blades to wear prematurely. Traces of sand, coarse gritty and abrasive herbs will also cause the blades to wear prematurely. Herbs may contain volatile oils, cause the container/cup to retain the oils and cause permanent discoloration. Your container/cup and blades are not covered under the Vitamix warranty under these circumstances.  Vitamix will not be responsible for the cost of any unauthorized warranty repairs.  REPAIR, REPLACEMENT OR REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ARE THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES OF PURCHASER AND THE SOLE LIABILITY OF VITAMIX UNDER THIS WARRANTY.

Abuse, misuse, negligent use, alteration of the Blender, exposure to abnormal or extreme conditions, or failure to follow the operating instructions in this manual will void this Warranty.

You can register online at www.vitamix.com/warranty; or by calling our Customer Service Department at 1.800.848.2649 or 1.440.235.4840. Failure to register your product purchase will not diminish your warranty rights. However, registering your purchase will allow Vitamix to better serve you with any of your customer service needs.  2. Who Can Seek Warranty Coverage.  This Warranty is extended by Vitamix to the owner of this Blender for personal household use only. This Warranty does not apply to products used for commercial, rental or re-sale purposes. Should ownership of the blender change during the 7-year period, please update the Blender’s owner information at www.vitamix.com.  3. What is Covered.  Vitamix warrants to the owner that if this Blender (a “Blender” consists of a motor base, any container(s), lids and tamper(s) pur- chased together) fails within 7 years from the earlier of the date of purchase or date of delivery as permitted by law due to a defect in material or workmanship or as a result of normal wear and tear from ordinary household use, Vitamix will, within 30 days of receipt of the returned blender, repair the failed Blender or component part of the Blender free of charge. If, in Vitamix’s sole discretion, the failed Blender or component part of the Blender cannot be repaired, Vitamix will elect to either (A) replace the Blender free of charge or (B) refund the full purchase price to the owner, unless Vitamix receives prior written notice of the owner’s preference.  4. What is Not Covered.  This Warranty does not apply to Blenders used commercially or in non-household applications. This Warranty does not cover cosmetic changes that do not affect performance, such as discoloration or the effects of the use of abrasives or cleaners or food build up. This Warranty is only valid if the Blender is used and maintained in accordance with the instructions, warnings and safeguards contained in the owner’s manual.  Containers: Grinding certain herbs and spices in the container/cup will result in cosmetic marring of the container/cup and may cause the blades to wear prematurely. Traces of sand, coarse gritty and abrasive herbs will also cause the blades to wear prematurely. Herbs may contain volatile oils, cause the container/cup to retain the oils and cause permanent discoloration. Your container/cup and blades are not covered under the Vitamix warranty under these circumstances.  Vitamix will not be responsible for the cost of any unauthorized warranty repairs.  REPAIR, REPLACEMENT OR REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ARE THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES OF PURCHASER AND THE SOLE LIABILITY OF VITAMIX UNDER THIS WARRANTY.

This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.  5. What Voids this Warranty.  Abuse, misuse, negligent use, alteration of the Blender, exposure to abnormal or extreme conditions, or failure to follow the operating instructions in this manual will void this Warranty. The Warranty is also void if repairs to the Blender or any component part of the Blender are performed by someone other than either Vitamix or an authorized Vitamix Service Provider or if any component part of a Blender subject to this Warranty is used in combination with a motor base or container that is not expressly authorized by Vitamix.  6.

Lid, Lid Plug and Tamper  •   Always use the lid and the lid plug when operating the  blender. •   Never operate the blender without checking to make sure  that the lid is securely locked in place. •   The lid plug is marked so it can be used as a measuring cup. •   Insert the lid plug through the lid plug opening. Lock the  plug in place by turning clockwise. To remove, turn counter-  clockwise and lift out. •   Remove the lid plug to use the tamper or to add  ingredients. Blade Scraper   - See Appendix 1 - Accessories  Tamper Holder   - See Appendix 1 - Accessories  Motor   - The motor is designed to protect itself from  overheating. If the blender will not start immediately check to  make sure you have plugged the unit in and the On/Off switch  is On. If the motor has overheated, allow the motor to cool for  20-45 minutes. Tips to prevent ‘overloading’ your blender:  •   Process only Vitamix recipes when learning to use the  blender. •   Do not process recipes at lower or higher speeds than  recommended. •   Do not process recipes for longer than recommended. •   Use your tamper to process thicker mixtures and keep  ingredients moving around and through the blades. 48 oz.",

Lids and tampers are not interchangeable between  different container styles, types and sizes. Use the  tamper and lid that was supplied with your blender. How to Determine the Tamper to be Used with Your  Container  Before using a tamper during the blending, verify that  you have the correct tamper. Only use the tamper  with the lid securely locked in place and the lid plug  removed. If a tamper came with your blender at  purchase, it is the correct tamper to use. If a tamper  did not come with your blender or you want to  determine if a tamper that you already have can be  used with your new container, please use these steps  and illustrations to determine what tamper to use. 1. Place the lid on an empty container. 64 oz. / 2,0 L (SHORT) 64 oz. / 2,0 L (TALL)  The 64 oz. / 2 L   Short   (or Low Profile) Container uses a  tamper which is approximately 11 inches long.

Add liquid if necessary. Replace the lid and lid plug. Return the container to the blender  base and continue blending. 8. After blending, wait until the blades completely stop before removing the lid or container from the blender base. Tips to prevent ‘overloading’ your blender:  •   Process only Vitamix recipes when learning to use the blender. •   Do not process recipes at lower or higher speeds than recommended. •   Do not process recipes for longer than recommended. •   Use your tamper to process thicker mixtures and keep ingredients moving around and through the blades. How to use the Tamper:  IMPORTANT! The splash disk (near the top of the tamper) and lid prevent the tamper from hitting the blades when the lid  is secured properly in the locked position. •   The container should not be more than two-thirds full when the tamper is used during blending. •   To avoid overheating during blending, DO NOT use the tamper for more than 30 consecutive seconds. •   If the food does not circulate, the blender may have trapped an air bubble. Carefully remove the lid plug, while making  sure the lid stays firmly in place. Release the air bubble by inserting the tamper through the lid plug opening. •   Holding the tamper straight down may not help the ingredients circulate. If necessary, point the tamper towards the  sides or corners of the container. DO NOT try to force the tamper deeper into the container. 7  Blender Base  1. Turn off and unplug the blender. 2.

Lavez le récipient, le couvercle, le  bouchon du couvercle et le pilon dans l'eau tiède savonneuse. Rincez toutes les pièces. Essuyez-les à l'aide d'un chiffon doux et sec. 2. Choisissez un endroit sur le comptoir qui est plat, sec et propre. Branchez le mélangeur sur une prise triphasée avec mise à la terre. Remarque :   Votre récipient Vitamix est conçu pour être entièrement lavé sans retirer l'écrou de serrage et l'assemblage de lames. N'essayez  PAS de retirer l'écrou de serrage ou l'assemblage de lames du récipient. Nos procédures courantes de nettoyage et de désinfection ou  encore un cycle de nettoyage au lave-vaisselle assureront un nettoyage complet et en profondeur de votre récipient et de ses composants. Si votre récipient est endommagé, ne l'utilisez pas. Communiquez IMMÉDIATEMENT avec le service à la clientèle Vitamix pour obtenir de  l'aide. 7. Si le mélange cesse de circuler, insérez le pilon par l'ouverture du couvercle et remuez jusqu'à ce que l'air s'échappe. Si cette méthode  ne fonctionne pas, appuyez sur l'interrupteur Marche/Arrêt pour arrêter le moteur. Retirez le récipient du socle du mélangeur et  utilisez une spatule de caoutchouc pour faire éclater la bulle d'air autour des lames. Ajoutez du liquide, au besoin. Replacez le  couvercle et le bouchon du couvercle. Remettez le récipient sur la base du mélangeur et continuez de mélanger. 8. Une fois le mélange terminé, attendez que les lames soient complètement arrêtées avant de retirer le couvercle ou le récipient du  socle du mélangeur. Conseils pour éviter de surcharger votre mélangeur :  •   Préparez uniquement des recettes Vitamix lorsque vous apprenez à vous servir de votre mélangeur. •   Ne mélangez pas de recettes à des vitesses inférieures ou supérieures à celles recommandées. •   Ne mélangez pas de recettes plus longtemps que le temps recommandé.",

Comment utiliser le pilon :  IMPORTANT! Le disque antiéclaboussure (près de la partie supérieure du pilon) et le couvercle empêchent le pilon d'entrer en contact  avec les lames lorsque le couvercle est fixé adéquatement en position verrouillée. •   Le récipient ne doit pas être rempli à plus des deux tiers de sa capacité lorsque le pilon est utilisé pendant le fonctionnement de  l'appareil. •   Afin d'éviter la surchauffe pendant le fonctionnement, n'utilisez PAS le pilon pendant plus de 30 secondes consécutives. •   Si les aliments ne circulent pas, le mélangeur pourrait avoir créé une bulle d'air. Retirez prudemment le bouchon du couvercle en  vous assurant que le couvercle demeure bien en place. Laissez l'air de la bulle s'échapper en insérant le pilon par l'ouverture du  bouchon du couvercle. •   Tenir le pilon tout droit vers le bas n'aide pas forcément les ingrédients à circuler. Au besoin, dirigez le pilon vers les côtés ou les  coins du récipient. Ne tentez PAS de faire entrer le pilon plus profondément dans le récipient. 19  Base pour mélangeur  1. Éteignez et débranchez le mélangeur. ATTENTION  Risque de décharge électrique  Débranchez toujours le mélangeur avant de nettoyer le socle ou lorsqu'il n'est pas en marche. N'immergez pas le socle du mélangeur dans l'eau ou dans d'autres liquides. Le non-respect de ces instructions peut causer la mort ou une décharge électrique.

NO intente retirar la tuerca de retención ni el conjunto de cuchillas del vaso. Nuestros procedimientos normales de limpieza y  desinfección así como el ciclo de limpieza de una lavavajillas garantizan una limpieza completa y exhaustiva de su vaso y sus componentes. Si su vaso está dañado, evite usarlo. Póngase en contacto INMEDIATAMENTE con Servicio al Cliente de Vitamix para solicitar asistencia. 7.

Vuelva a colocar la tapa y el  tapón de la tapa. Coloque nuevamente el vaso en la base de la licuadora y continúe licuando. 8. Al finalizar el licuado, espere hasta que las cuchillas se detengan por completo antes de retirar la tapa o el vaso de la base de la  licuadora. Consejos para evitar \"sobrecargar\" su licuadora:  •   Procese únicamente recetas Vitamix cuando esté aprendiendo a utilizar la licuadora. •   No procese recetas a velocidades menores o mayores que las recomendadas. •   No procese recetas por más tiempo que el recomendado. •   Utilice su barra presionadora para procesar mezclas más espesas y mantener a los ingredientes moviéndose alrededor y a través de  las cuchillas. Cómo utilizar la barra presionadora:  ¡IMPORTANTE! El disco antisalpicaduras (cerca de la parte superior de la barra presionadora) y la tapa evitan que la barra presionadora  golpee las cuchillas cuando la tapa está correctamente asegurada en su lugar. •   El vaso no deberá llenarse más de dos tercios de su capacidad cuando se utilice la barra presionadora durante el licuado. •   Para evitar un sobrecalentamiento durante el licuado, NO utilice la barra presionadora por más de 30 segundos consecutivos. •   Si los alimentos no circulan, la licuadora podría haber atrapado una burbuja de aire. Retire con cuidado el tapón de la tapa  asegurándose de que la tapa permanezca firmemente en su lugar. Libere la burbuja de aire insertando la barra presionadora a través  de la abertura del tapón dela tapa. •   Sostener la barra presionadora en forma recta no ayudará a que los ingredientes circulen.",
