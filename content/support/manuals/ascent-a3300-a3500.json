The cover must remain in place when  using the tamper through the lid plug  opening. A utensil may be used in the  container only when the it has been  removed from the motor base. 21. The tamper provided must be used only  when the main part of the lid is in place. 22. Blades are sharp. Clean around the blade  assembly in the container with extreme  care to avoid injury. To reduce the risk of  injury, never place a blade assembly on  the motor base unless assembled to the  Vitamix container. 23. Care should be taken when handling  the sharp cutting blades, emptying the  container and during cleaning. 24. Do not leave foreign objects, such as  spoons, forks, knives or the lid plug, in the  container as this will damage the blades  and other components when starting the  blender and may cause injury. 25. Never attempt to operate with damaged blades. 26. Never attempt to operate with the  centering pad removed. 27. When blending hot liquids or ingredients  in the 64 oz. (Large) container, use  caution; spray or escaping steam may  cause burns. Do not fill container to  the maximum capacity. Always begin  processing on the lowest speed setting,  variable speed 1. Keep hands and other  exposed skin away from lid opening to  prevent possible burns. 28. DO NOT use your 20 ounce cup or 8  ounce cup to heat ingredients or to blend  hot liquids. Heated ingredients and liquids  may create internal pressure which could  cause the cup to burst and cause injury. 29. DO NOT continuously use your machine  for more than 2 minutes with the 20 ounce  cup or 75 seconds for the 8 ounce cup. 30. If a cup becomes warm to the touch  or steams or vents, immediately stop  blending ingredients and turn off or  unplug blender. 31. When making nut butters or oil-based  foods, do not process for more than  one minute after the mixture starts to  circulate in the container.",

If the blender will not start  immediately check to make sure you have plugged the unit in and the On/Off switch is On. If the  motor has overheated, allow the motor to cool for 20-45 minutes. Tips to prevent ‘overloading’ your blender:  Process only Vitamix recipes when learning to use the blender. Do not process recipes at lower  speeds than recommended. Do not process recipes at higher speeds than recommended. Do not process recipes for longer than recommended. Use your tamper to process thicker  mixtures and keep ingredients moving around and through the blades. Tamper   - Lids and tampers are not interchangeable between different container styles, types  and sizes. Use the tamper that was supplied with your blender. The container should not be more than two-thirds full when the tamper is used during blending. To avoid overheating, DO NOT use the tamper for more than 30 consecutive seconds. 6  Container, Lid, Lid Plug and Tamper  Accessories  Accessories are available for creative recipe development.

WARNING  To Avoid Possible Burns, Never Start on Speeds Above 1 when Processing Hot Liquids in a Large Container. Escaping steam, splashes or contents may burn. Always start on Variable 1, then slowly increase to 10. DO NOT use your 20 oz. (0.6 L) cup or 8 oz. (225 ml) bowl to heat ingredients or to blend hot liquids. Heated  ingredients and liquids may create internal pressure which could cause the cup to burst and cause injury. DO NOT continuously use your machine for more than 75 seconds for the 20 oz.

Allow the cup and ingredients to cool to room temperature before removing the blade base. Parts will become hot with extended use. DO NOT   touch the drive socket in the blender base or the drive spline in the blade base. To avoid damage or personal injury, DO NOT use the cups (including the blade base or lids) in the microwave. WARNING  To Avoid Injury. NEVER TOUCH MOVING PARTS. Keep hands and utensils out of containers and cups during blender operation. DO NOT   insert  fingers or utensils around the blades while the blades are spinning. The blades will continue to spin until they come to a complete stop at the end of the blend cycle.

Conseils pour prévenir la « surcharge » de votre mélangeur :  Pour apprendre à utiliser le mélangeur, ne préparez que des recettes Vitamix. Ne réduisez pas les  vitesses de préparation recommandées pour les recettes. Ne dépassez pas les vitesses de préparation  recommandées pour les recettes. Ne dépassez pas les temps de mélange recommandés pour les  recettes. Utilisez votre pilon pour préparer des mélanges plus épais et garder les ingrédients en  mouvement autour des couteaux et entre ceux-ci. Pilon   - Les couvercles et les pilons ne sont pas interchangeables entre les récipients de différents styles,  types et formats. Utilisez le pilon qui a été fourni avec votre mélangeur. Le récipient ne doit pas être rempli plus qu'aux deux tiers lorsque le pilon est utilisé pendant le mélange. Pour éviter de faire surchauffer l'appareil pendant le mélange, N'utilisez PAS le pilon pendant plus de  30 secondes consécutives. 18  Récipient, couvercle, bouchon du couvercle et pilon  •   Utilisez toujours le couvercle et le bouchon du couvercle pendant le mélange. •   Ne faites jamais fonctionner le mélangeur sans vous assurer que le couvercle est  bien verrouillé en place. •   Le bouchon du couvercle comporte un marquage qui permet de l'utiliser comme  tasse à mesurer. •   Insérez   le   bouchon   du   couvercle   dans   l'orifice   pour   bouchon   du   couvercle. Fixez le bouchon en place en le tournant dans le sens horaire. Pour l'enlever,  tournez-le dans le sens antihoraire et soulevez-le.",

Vita-Mix Corporation (« Vitamix ») vous recommande vivement d'enregistrer votre achat en remplissant et en retournant la carte d'enregistrement du produit fournie avec ce  mélangeur. Vous pouvez enregistrer votre produit en ligne sur vitamix.com/warranty ou en appelant notre service à la clientèle au +1 800 848-2649 ou au +1 440 235-4840. Le fait de ne pas enregistrer votre appareil ne diminuera en rien vos droits de garantie. Toutefois, l'enregistrement de votre achat permettra à Vitamix de mieux vous servir, peu  importe vos besoins. 2. PERSONNES POUVANT BÉNÉFICIER DE CETTE GARANTIE. Cette garantie est offerte par Vitamix au propriétaire de ce mélangeur pour un usage domestique personnel seulement. Cette garantie ne s'applique pas aux appareils utilisés  à des fins commerciales, de location ou de revente. Si le mélangeur change de propriétaire pendant la période de 10 ans, veuillez mettre à jour les renseignements sur le  propriétaire du mélangeur sur le site vitamix.com. 3. CE QUI EST COUVERT. Vitamix garantit au propriétaire que si ce mélangeur   (un « mélangeur » consiste en le socle-moteur du mélangeur et le ou les récipients, couvercles et pilons achetés  ensemble)   ne fonctionne plus dans les 10 ans suivant la date d'achat en raison d'un défaut de matériau ou de fabrication ou à la suite d'une usure normale pour un usage  domestique, Vitamix procédera, dans les 30 jours suivant la réception du mélangeur retourné, à la réparation du mélangeur ou du composant du mélangeur défaillant sans frais.",

Si, à la seule discrétion de Vitamix, le mélangeur ou le composant du mélangeur défaillant ne peut pas être réparé, Vitamix décidera soit (A) de remplacer le mélangeur sans  frais ou (B) de rembourser le prix d'achat total au propriétaire, à moins que Vitamix reçoive un préavis écrit indiquant la préférence du propriétaire. 4. CE QUI N'EST PAS COUVERT. Cette garantie ne s'applique pas aux mélangeurs utilisés pour des applications commerciales ou autres que domestiques. Cette garantie ne couvre pas les changements  superficiels qui n'affectent pas la performance de l'appareil comme la décoloration, les effets de l'utilisation d'abrasifs ou de nettoyants ou les accumulations d'aliments. Cette  garantie n'est valable que si le mélangeur est utilisé et entretenu conformément aux instructions, aux avertissements et aux consignes de sécurité contenus dans le manuel  d'utilisation. Récipients : le fait de moudre certaines herbes et épices dans le récipient/la tasse entraînera la présence de marques superficielles sur le récipient/la tasse et peut  provoquer une usure prématurée des couteaux. Des traces de sable, des herbes abrasives ou comportant de gros grains peuvent également causer une usure prématurée  des couteaux. Des herbes peuvent également contenir des huiles volatiles, ce qui entraîne une rétention des huiles par le récipient/la tasse et ainsi une décoloration  permanente de ces objets. Votre récipient/tasse et vos couteaux ne sont pas couverts par la garantie de Vitamix dans ces circonstances. Vitamix ne pourra pas être tenue responsable du coût de réparations sous garantie non autorisées.",
