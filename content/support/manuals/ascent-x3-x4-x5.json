NEVER insert fingers or utensils around the blades while the blades are spinning. NEVER fill the container above the “MAXIMUM CAPACITY” line to avoid risk of injury caused by damage to the lid and container. To avoid possible burns, NEVER start on speeds above Variable Speed 1 when processing hot liquids in a large container. Escaping steam, splashes, or contents may burn. ALWAYS operate with the lid and lid plug in place and start on Variable Speed 1, then slowly increase to 10. Parts will become hot with extended use. NEVER touch the motor base drive socket or the drive spline in the blade base. TIPS TO PREVENT OVERHEATING  •   Process only Vitamix recipes when learning to use the appliance. •   NEVER process recipes at lower or higher speeds than recommended. Speed is indicated both numerically and visually by the completion of the circular indicator around the number as illustrated below. USER NOTIFICATIONS  •   Overheating Notification   - NEVER process recipes for longer than recommended. Over-processed blends can result in the incorrect recipe texture and overheat the appliance. The temperature indicators help identify overheating conditions. •   Use Tamper Notification   - Use the tamper to process thicker mixtures and keep ingredients moving around and through the blades. The tamper indicators, available on the Ascent X4 and X5 models, help during recipe programs to determine the best times to use the tamper.",

NE TOUCHEZ JAMAIS LES PIÈCES EN MOUVEMENT. Gardez les mains et les ustensiles hors du récipient pendant le fonctionnement de l'appareil. N' insérez jamais vos doigts ou des ustensiles autour des lames lorsque celles-ci tournent. NE remplissez JAMAIS le récipient au-dessus de la ligne « CAPACITÉ MAXIMALE » marquée pour éviter tout risque de blessure causée par des dommages au couvercle et au récipient. Pour éviter d'éventuelles brûlures, NE COMMENCEZ JAMAIS à des vitesses supérieures à la vitesse variable 1 lors du traitement de liquides chauds dans un grand récipient. La vapeur qui s'échappe, les éclaboussures ou le contenu peuvent brûler. UTILISEZ TOUJOURS avec le couvercle et le bouchon en place et commencez à vitesse variable 1, puis augmentez lentement jusqu'à 10. Les pièces deviennent chaudes en cas d'utilisation prolongée. NE touchez JAMAIS la douille d'entraînement de la base du moteur ou la cannelure d'entraînement de la base de la lame.

NOTIFICACIONES DE USUARIO  •   Notificación de sobrecalentamiento:   NUNCA procese recetas por más tiempo del recomendado. Las mezclas procesadas en exceso pueden dar como resultado una textura incorrecta de la receta y sobrecalentar el aparato. Los indicadores de temperatura ayudan a identificar las condiciones de sobrecalentamiento. •   Utilice el aviso de la barra presionadora:   utilice la barra presionadora para procesar mezclas más espesas y mantener los ingredientes en movimiento alrededor y a través de las aspas.

Qué no cubre. La presente garantía no aplica a las licuadoras usadas con fines comerciales o en aplicaciones que no sean de uso doméstico. Esta garantía no cubre cambios en el aspecto que no afecten el rendimiento, tales como la decoloración o los efectos debido al uso de abrasivos o limpiadores o la acumulación de alimentos. Esta garantía solamente será válida si la Licuadora se utiliza y recibe mantenimiento de acuerdo con las instrucciones, advertencias y medidas de seguridad contenidas en el Manual del propietario.

Los rastros de arena, granos gruesos y hierbas abrasivas también podrían ocasionar un desgaste prematuro de las cuchillas. Las hierbas pueden contener aceites volátiles y causar que el vaso retenga dichos aceites ocasionando una decoloración permanente.
