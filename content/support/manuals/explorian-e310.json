Clean around the blade assembly in the  container with extreme care to avoid injury. 20. To reduce the risk of injury, never place a blade assembly on  the motor base unless assembled to the Vitamix container. 21. Care should be taken when handling the sharp cutting blades,  emptying the container and during cleaning. 22. Do not leave foreign objects, such as spoons, forks, knives or  the lid plug, in the container as this will damage the blades  and other components when starting the blender and may  cause injury. 23. Never attempt to operate with damaged blades. 24. Never attempt to operate with the centering pad removed. 25. Always operate blender with lid and lid plug firmly in place. DO NOT remove 2-part lid while blades are rotating. Only  remove the lid plug to add ingredients and to use the tamper. 26. When blending hot liquids or ingredients in the 48 oz. container, use caution; spray or escaping steam may cause  burns. Do not fill container to the maximum capacity.

Only use the tamper  with the lid securely locked in place and the lid plug  removed. If a tamper came with your blender at  purchase, it is the correct tamper to use. If a tamper  did not come with your blender or you want to  determine if a tamper that you already have can be  used with your new container, please use these steps  and illustrations to determine what tamper to use. 1. Place the lid on an empty container. 64 oz. / 2,0 L (SHORT) 64 oz. / 2,0 L (TALL)  The 64 oz. / 2 L   Short   (or Low Profile) Container uses a  tamper which is approximately 11 inches long.

How to use the Tamper:  IMPORTANT! The splash disk (near the top of the tamper) and lid prevent the tamper from hitting the blades when the lid  is secured properly in the locked position. •   The container should not be more than two-thirds full when the tamper is used during blending. •   To avoid overheating during blending, DO NOT use the tamper for more than 30 consecutive seconds. •   If the food does not circulate, the blender may have trapped an air bubble. Carefully remove the lid plug, while making  sure the lid stays firmly in place. Release the air bubble by inserting the tamper through the lid plug opening. •   Holding the tamper straight down may not help the ingredients circulate. If necessary, point the tamper towards the  sides or corners of the container. DO NOT try to force the tamper deeper into the container. 7  Blender Base  1. Turn off and unplug the blender. 2.

Remarque :   Votre récipient Vitamix est conçu pour être entièrement lavé sans retirer l'écrou de serrage et l'assemblage de lames. N'essayez  PAS de retirer l'écrou de serrage ou l'assemblage de lames du récipient. Nos procédures courantes de nettoyage et de désinfection ou  encore un cycle de nettoyage au lave-vaisselle assureront un nettoyage complet et en profondeur de votre récipient et de ses composants.

Si le mélange cesse de circuler, insérez le pilon par l'ouverture du couvercle et remuez jusqu'à ce que l'air s'échappe. Si cette méthode  ne fonctionne pas, appuyez sur l'interrupteur Marche/Arrêt pour arrêter le moteur.

Comment utiliser le pilon :  IMPORTANT! Le disque antiéclaboussure (près de la partie supérieure du pilon) et le couvercle empêchent le pilon d'entrer en contact  avec les lames lorsque le couvercle est fixé adéquatement en position verrouillée. •   Le récipient ne doit pas être rempli à plus des deux tiers de sa capacité lorsque le pilon est utilisé pendant le fonctionnement de  l'appareil. •   Afin d'éviter la surchauffe pendant le fonctionnement, n'utilisez PAS le pilon pendant plus de 30 secondes consécutives. •   Si les aliments ne circulent pas, le mélangeur pourrait avoir créé une bulle d'air. Retirez prudemment le bouchon du couvercle en  vous assurant que le couvercle demeure bien en place. Laissez l'air de la bulle s'échapper en insérant le pilon par l'ouverture du  bouchon du couvercle. •   Tenir le pilon tout droit vers le bas n'aide pas forcément les ingrédients à circuler. Au besoin, dirigez le pilon vers les côtés ou les  coins du récipient. Ne tentez PAS de faire entrer le pilon plus profondément dans le récipient. 19  Base pour mélangeur  1.

CE QUI N'EST PAS COUVERT  Cette garantie ne s'applique pas aux mélangeurs qui ont été utilisés pour des applications commerciales ou autres que domestiques. Elle  ne couvre pas les changements d'ordre esthétique qui n'affectent pas la performance, tels que la décoloration, les effets de l'utilisation  d'abrasifs ou de nettoyants, ou des accumulations de nourriture. Cette garantie n'est valable que si le mélangeur est utilisé et entretenu  conformément aux instructions, aux mises en garde et aux mesures de sécurité contenues dans le guide d'utilisation. Récipients : Broyer certaines herbes et épices dans le récipient ou la tasse peut causer des rayures esthétiques sur le récipient ou la  tasse et provoquer l'usure prématurée des lames. Des traces de sable et d'herbes grossières, granuleuses et abrasives provoqueront  également l'usure prématurée des lames.
